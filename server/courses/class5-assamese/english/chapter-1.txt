## Let’s recite the poem:

### **All Things Bright and Beautiful**

All things bright and beautiful,  
All creatures great and small,  
All things wise and wonderful,  
The Lord God made them all.  

Each little flower that opens,  
Each little bird that sings,  
He made their glowing colours,  
He made their tiny wings.
