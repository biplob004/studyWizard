## Let’s find out what the two birds Robin and Jay are talking about.

### **Bird Talk**  
*By Aileen Fisher*

‘Think......’ said the robin,  
‘Think......’ said the jay,  
sitting in the garden  
talking one day.

‘Think about people  
the way they grow:  
they don’t have feathers  
at all, you know.

They don’t eat beetles,  
they don’t grow wings,  
they don’t like sitting  
on wires and things’.

‘Think!’ said the robin,  
‘Think!’ said the jay,  
‘Aren’t people funny  
to be that way?’
