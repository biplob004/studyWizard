## Let’s recite the poem:

### **Someone**  
*By Walter de la Mare*

Someone came knocking  
At my wee, small door;  
Someone came knocking,  
I’m sure—sure—sure;  
I listened, I opened,  
I looked to left and right,  
But nought there was a-stirring  
In the still, dark night;  
Only the busy beetle  
Tap-tapping in the wall,  
Only from the forest  
The screech-owl’s call,  
Only the cricket whistling  
While the dewdrops fall,  
So I know not who can be knocking,  
At all, at all, at all.
