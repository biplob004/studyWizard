The Joy of Helping

The School bell rang. Raju, Nita and Gita rushed to school as they were getting late. The morning assembly was about to begin. Somehow they managed to join the assembly.

At the end of the assembly, the headmaster announced: "I have something very important to tell you. We all know about the earthquake that occured yesterday. It destroyed many areas in our neigh bouring districts. People have lost their homes and belongings. Many people have died and many have got injured. So, We must help these people. please contribute whatever is possible for you. You can give food  items- fresh or dry, water bottles, clothes, money, etc. Tomorrow, after morning assembly, we will collect your contributions and a team of teachers and distribute these items among the earthquake victims."

Next day at school, all the children and teacher assembled in the school playground with their contributions. The headmaster thanked all of them for their support. The goods van a team of teacher and students then left for their destination.

Every one was very greateful to the volunteers for their help. The team members felt very happy to have helped the people in distress.
